# AI FXDealer — Project Baseline

## What This Is

A multi-tenant SaaS platform for Forex Brokers and Prop Trading Firms.

The platform:
- Collects trading, client, infrastructure, and market data from external systems
- Detects behavioral and technical risks via rule engines
- Assists or automates dealer decisions via an AI layer
- Provides monitoring, investigation tools, and action automation via a dashboard

Core data flow:
```
Collectors → Platform DB → Rule Engines → AI Layer → Dashboard / API → Actions
```

### Stack decisions — do not change without updating this file

**Python + FastAPI** — collector-heavy, analytics-heavy, rule-heavy, AI-heavy platform. Python fits better than Node.js or Go for data processing, async APIs, and AI integration.

**PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB** — tick data, latency series, event logs, and rule outputs are time-series workloads. TimescaleDB is a PostgreSQL extension — full SQL compatibility, native time-series partitioning. Do not use plain PostgreSQL for time-series tables.

**Redis Streams** — not plain Pub/Sub. Streams give at-least-once delivery with consumer groups and acknowledgment. Required for reliable collector job queuing.

**ARQ** — async job scheduler built on Redis. Used for collector scheduling (run incremental sync every N seconds per broker per server), rule engine job dispatch, and retry orchestration. Do not use cron or bare asyncio loops for scheduled collector runs.

**JWT** — B2B multi-tenant admin platform. JWT gives full control over broker_id, role, permissions, and token lifecycle. No Supabase Auth or Auth0 — external dependency where tight tenant-aware control is needed.

**AWS Secrets Manager** — all credentials (Manager API, CRM tokens, LP keys, SMTP, Telegram, Slack) stored in AWS Secrets Manager. Never in .env files committed to git. Never in plain environment variables in docker-compose for production.

**structlog + Prometheus + Grafana + Sentry** — structured logging from day one. Collector failures must be visible immediately. Silent failures on live broker data are a serious operational problem.

**Docker on AWS, monorepo, no Kubernetes** — all services in one repo. Kubernetes is premature complexity for Phase 1. Add ECS or EKS only when horizontal scaling is actually needed.

**MT5Manager pip** — official MetaQuotes Python SDK. Installed via `pip install MT5Manager`. Provides full Manager API access: accounts, deals, orders, positions, groups, symbols, ticks, server logs, balance operations. Windows-only binary — runs in Windows Docker container or Wine-based container on Linux.

**MT4 Manager API DLL** — MetaQuotes provides the Manager API as a C++ DLL. Wrapped in Python via `ctypes`. DLL is provided by each broker from their MetaTrader 4 Server installation. Windows-only.

**cTrader Manager API** — Spotware's Manager API uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) over TCP. Language-neutral. Python client built with `protobuf` + `grpcio` or raw TCP socket handling Protobuf-serialized messages. Docs: https://docs.spotware.com/en/Managers_API

**Prisma** — only if a product-facing CRUD service explicitly needs it. All collector and backend services use SQLAlchemy + Alembic.

### Monorepo dependency model

```
packages/shared     ← no internal dependencies
packages/db         ← depends on: shared
packages/queue      ← depends on: shared

services/api              ← depends on: shared, db, queue
services/collector-mt5    ← depends on: shared, db, queue
services/collector-mt4    ← depends on: shared, db, queue
services/collector-ctrader ← depends on: shared, db, queue
services/collector-fxbo   ← depends on: shared, db, queue
services/rule-engine      ← depends on: shared, db, queue
services/ai-layer         ← depends on: shared, db, queue
```

Each service has its own `pyproject.toml` with local package references. Shared packages are never copied — always imported as workspace dependencies.

---

## Environment Configuration Standard

### Naming convention

All environment variables use the prefix `FXDEALER_`:

```
FXDEALER_DB_URL
FXDEALER_REDIS_URL
FXDEALER_JWT_SECRET
FXDEALER_JWT_EXPIRY_SECONDS
FXDEALER_AWS_REGION
FXDEALER_SENTRY_DSN
FXDEALER_LOG_LEVEL
```

### Environment files

```
.env.local         ← local dev only, never committed
.env.test          ← test environment, committed (no real secrets)
.env.example       ← template with all keys, no values, committed
```

### Secret storage by environment

| Secret type | Local dev | Production |
|---|---|---|
| DB credentials | .env.local | AWS Secrets Manager |
| JWT secret | .env.local | AWS Secrets Manager |
| MT5 Manager credentials | .env.local | AWS Secrets Manager |
| MT4 DLL path + credentials | .env.local | AWS Secrets Manager |
| cTrader API credentials | .env.local | AWS Secrets Manager |
| CRM API keys | .env.local | AWS Secrets Manager |
| Notification tokens | .env.local | AWS Secrets Manager |

### Rules

- Never hardcode secrets in code
- Never commit .env.local
- Never use plain environment variables for production secrets
- Always retrieve from AWS Secrets Manager at service startup
- .env.example must be kept up to date with every new variable

---

## Multi-Tenancy Architecture

This is a strict multi-tenant SaaS. Getting this wrong is a legal and security problem.

### Tenant model

- Each broker or prop firm = one tenant
- Primary tenant key = `broker_id` (UUID)
- One broker can have multiple trading servers, CRM connections, and integrations
- Collectors are instantiated per broker per source connection/server

### Core tenant entities

```
brokers
broker_users
broker_servers
broker_crm_connections
broker_integrations
broker_roles
audit_logs
```

### Data isolation rules

- ALL tenant-owned tables MUST include `broker_id`
- ALL application queries MUST filter by `broker_id`
- ALL API requests MUST resolve `broker_id` from authenticated JWT context
- API middleware MUST enforce `broker_id` scope BEFORE route logic executes
- Background jobs and collectors MUST run in broker-scoped context
- Audit logs MUST include `broker_id` AND `actor_id`
- Cross-tenant access is forbidden by default — no exceptions

### Authenticated request context

Every authenticated request resolves:
```
user_id
broker_id
role
permissions
```

Middleware enforces:
- User belongs to broker
- Route permits role
- Requested resource belongs to same broker

### Collector instantiation model

```python
collector_instance = {
    "broker_id": ...,
    "source_system": ...,      # mt4 | mt5 | ctrader | fxbo | bridge | lp | news | calendar
    "connection_id": ...,
    "server_id": ...,
    "sync_mode": ...,          # bootstrap | incremental
    "status": ...,
    "cursor": ...,
    "last_success_at": ...
}
```

---

## RBAC — Roles and Permissions

RBAC enforced in API middleware before any route logic executes.

### Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `admin` | Full access. Manages users, config, rules, executes all actions. |
| `dealer` | Investigates accounts, views all data, executes dealer actions. Cannot manage users. |
| `readonly` | Views data and dashboards only. Cannot execute actions or change config. |

### Permissions by resource

| Resource | admin | dealer | readonly |
|---|---|---|---|
| View accounts / trades / positions | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View rule findings / evidence | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View monitoring dashboards | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View AI suggestions | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View audit logs | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Execute dealer actions (profit adj, restrictions) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Approve / reject AI suggestions | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manage tags | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Configure rules and thresholds | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage automation triggers | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Invite / remove team members | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Assign roles | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Configure trading server connections | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Configure notification connectors | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Enforcement rules

- RBAC check in middleware, never inside route handlers
- Action routes check both role AND broker_id ownership
- A user cannot assign a role higher than their own
- A user cannot remove themselves from a broker
- All action attempts logged in audit_logs including rejected ones

## Integration Details

### MT5 — MT5Manager Python Package

**Library:** `MT5Manager` (official MetaQuotes Python SDK)
**Install:** `pip install MT5Manager`
**PyPI:** https://pypi.org/project/mt5manager/
**Docs:** https://support.metaquotes.net/en/docs/mt5/api/managerapi_python

Key facts:
- Official MetaQuotes package — not a third-party wrapper
- Provides full Manager API access as a Python developer
- Windows-only binary (ships as a `.whl` for `win_amd64`)
- Requires numpy >= 1.7
- For Linux deployment: run collector-mt5 service in a Windows Docker container or Wine-based container
- Connects to MT5 Server as manager — not as a trading account
- Supports: accounts, deals, orders, positions, symbols, groups, ticks, server logs, balance operations, margin events

**SDK examples available** (from MetaTrader5SDK):
```
Manager/BalanceExample       ← balance operations reference
Manager/DealerExample        ← dealer workflow reference
Manager/ManagerAPIExtension  ← API extension reference
Manager/SimpleDealer         ← minimal dealer implementation
Manager/SimpleManager        ← minimal manager implementation
```

Reference docs: `.claude/references/mql5/` and `.claude/references/mt5manager-sdk/`

**Collector pattern:**
```python
import MT5Manager

class MT5Collector(BaseCollector):
    def connect(self):
        self.manager = MT5Manager.ManagerAPI()
        self.manager.Connect(server, login, password)

    def fetch_entity(self, entity_name, **kwargs):
        # Returns raw dicts — store exactly as received
        ...
```

---

### MT4 — Manager API DLL via ctypes

**Library:** MT4 Manager API DLL (C++ library from MetaQuotes)
**Format:** `.dll` file provided by each broker's MT4 Server installation
**Python access:** `ctypes` wrapper

Key facts:
- Not pip-installable — DLL is provided directly by MetaQuotes to licensed brokers
- Each broker client provides their own DLL from their server installation
- Windows-only — run collector-mt4 in a Windows Docker container
- Full admin access: accounts, orders, deals, positions, groups, symbols, ticks, server logs
- DLL path configured per broker via AWS Secrets Manager / environment config
- Never hardcode DLL path — always load from broker connection config

**SDK examples available** (from MetaTrader5SDK, also applies to MT4 pattern):
```
Manager/BalanceExample       ← balance operations
Manager/DealerExample        ← dealer workflow
Manager/SimpleManager        ← manager connection baseline
Report/Trades.Standard.Reports ← trade report reference
Report/Accounts.Standard.Reports ← account report reference
```

**Collector pattern:**
```python
import ctypes

class MT4Collector(BaseCollector):
    def connect(self):
        dll_path = get_secret(f"fxdealer/broker/{self.broker_id}/mt4_dll_path")
        self.lib = ctypes.WinDLL(dll_path)
        # Init and connect via DLL functions
```

Reference docs: `.claude/references/mql4/`

---

### cTrader — Spotware Manager API (Protobuf over TCP)

**Library:** Spotware Manager API
**Protocol:** Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) over TCP
**Docs:** https://docs.spotware.com/en/Managers_API
**Python deps:** `protobuf`, `grpcio` (or raw TCP with Protobuf serialization)

Key facts:
- Language-neutral — Python client built against the Protobuf schema
- Protobuf messages define all entities: accounts, orders, deals, positions, ticks, execution reports
- Two data sources: real-time Manager API + Report API (use both, store separately)
- Keep endpoint/version metadata in every raw payload record
- TCP connection is persistent — handle reconnects explicitly in collector

**Collector pattern:**
```python
import grpc
# or raw socket with protobuf serialization

class CTraderCollector(BaseCollector):
    def connect(self):
        # Establish TCP connection to cTrader Manager API
        # Authenticate with credentials from AWS Secrets Manager
        ...

    def fetch_entity(self, entity_name, **kwargs):
        # Serialize request as Protobuf, send over TCP
        # Deserialize response, return as dict
        ...
```

Reference docs: `.claude/references/ctrader/`

---

### FXBO CRM

**Integration:** Read-only REST API or direct DB access
**Mode:** Initial full sync → incremental polling (no writeback in Phase 1)
**Source identifiers:** Preserved exactly, no transformation in raw layer

Entities: `clients, trading_accounts, ibs, transactions, deposits, withdrawals, reports, relation_data`

Reference docs: `.claude/references/fxbo/`

---

## Database Policy

### Raw source data rules

- Raw data MUST be stored EXACTLY as returned by the source
- Raw source payload MUST always be preserved in `payload_json`
- NO normalization in raw tables
- NO business interpretation in raw tables
- Raw tables are the source of truth for replay, debugging, and parser fixes
- Raw source records are append-only — archive instead of delete
- Corrections or re-syncs MUST create superseding records

### Schema design process (critical)

```
For each external integration:
1. Connect to source
2. Inspect actual response payload
3. Store exact raw payload
4. Design raw schema based on REAL returned fields
5. Add normalized/derived schema only in later phases
```

Do NOT design raw schemas from imagination. Design from real source responses.

### Raw table standard pattern

```sql
id                   UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
broker_id            UUID NOT NULL
source_system        VARCHAR NOT NULL   -- mt4 | mt5 | ctrader | fxbo | ...
source_entity        VARCHAR NOT NULL   -- deals | orders | accounts | ...
source_server_id     UUID
external_id          VARCHAR            -- nullable if source has none
payload_json         JSONB NOT NULL     -- exact source payload, never modified
collected_at         TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL
source_timestamp     TIMESTAMPTZ        -- nullable
ingestion_hash       VARCHAR            -- for deduplication
status               VARCHAR NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active'  -- active | archived | superseded
created_at           TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
updated_at           TIMESTAMPTZ
archived_at          TIMESTAMPTZ
```

### Hybrid raw storage (Phase 1 standard)

Keep `payload_json` AND extract top-level fields for indexing/filtering.

Example for MT5 deals:
```sql
raw_mt5_deals (
    id, broker_id, server_id,
    deal_id, login, symbol,
    volume, price, time_msc,
    action, entry,
    payload_json,
    collected_at
)
```

### TimescaleDB hypertable policy

MUST be hypertables (partitioned by `collected_at`):
```
raw_mt4_ticks              raw_mt5_ticks
raw_mt4_deals              raw_mt5_deals
raw_mt4_orders             raw_mt5_orders
raw_ctrader_ticks          raw_ctrader_execution_reports
raw_lp_quotes              raw_lp_execution_metrics
raw_connectivity_logs      raw_bridge_routing_logs
raw_collector_runs         raw_collector_errors
raw_news_events            raw_economic_calendar_events
```

Stay as plain PostgreSQL (low volume, config/reference):
```
brokers                    broker_servers
broker_users               broker_roles
broker_crm_connections     broker_integrations
audit_logs                 raw_mt4_accounts
raw_mt5_accounts           raw_mt4_symbols
raw_mt5_symbols            raw_fxbo_clients
raw_fxbo_accounts          raw_fxbo_ibs
```

### Indexing strategy

```sql
-- All raw tables
CREATE INDEX ON raw_<table> (broker_id, collected_at DESC);

-- Login / account tables
CREATE INDEX ON raw_mt5_deals (broker_id, login, collected_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX ON raw_mt5_orders (broker_id, login, collected_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX ON raw_mt5_accounts (broker_id, login);

-- Symbol tables
CREATE INDEX ON raw_mt5_deals (broker_id, symbol, collected_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX ON raw_mt5_ticks (broker_id, symbol, collected_at DESC);

-- Deduplication
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON raw_mt5_deals (broker_id, server_id, deal_id)
  WHERE status = 'active';

-- Collector operations
CREATE INDEX ON raw_collector_runs (broker_id, source_system, collected_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX ON raw_collector_errors (broker_id, source_system, collected_at DESC);
```

Apply equivalent patterns to MT4, cTrader, and FXBO tables.

### Data retention policy

| Table category | Retention |
|---|---|
| Raw tick data | 90 days (TimescaleDB retention policy) |
| Raw deals, orders, positions | 2 years |
| Raw account data | Indefinite |
| Connectivity and collector logs | 180 days |
| Rule engine outputs | 2 years |
| AI suggestions and decisions | Indefinite |
| Audit logs | Indefinite |
| News and economic events | Indefinite |

Use TimescaleDB `add_retention_policy()`. Define in Alembic migrations, not manually.

---

## Phase 1 Database Tables

## BaseCollector Contract

All collector services MUST implement this interface (in `packages/shared/base_collector.py`).

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class BaseCollector(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def connect(self) -> None:
        """Establish connection to source system."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def health_check(self) -> dict:
        """Verify connection is alive. Return status dict."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def bootstrap_sync(self, start_time=None, end_time=None) -> dict:
        """Full historical backfill for all entities."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def incremental_sync(self, cursor=None) -> dict:
        """Ongoing collection from last known cursor."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def fetch_entity(self, entity_name: str, **kwargs) -> list[dict]:
        """Fetch a specific entity from source. Returns raw dicts."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def save_raw(self, entity_name: str, records: list[dict]) -> int:
        """Store raw records exactly as received. Returns count saved."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def log_run(self, result: dict) -> None:
        """Write collector run result to raw_collector_runs."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def handle_error(self, error: Exception, context: dict) -> None:
        """Handle and log error to raw_collector_errors."""
        pass
```

### Required collector metadata
```python
broker_id         # UUID — tenant scope
source_system     # mt4 | mt5 | ctrader | fxbo | bridge | lp | news | calendar
connection_id     # UUID
server_id         # UUID
sync_mode         # bootstrap | incremental
cursor            # last processed timestamp or ID
last_success_at   # datetime
status            # connected | disconnected | error | syncing
```

---

## Error Handling Standard

### Collector error policy

```
On connection failure:
  1. Log warning (broker_id, source_system, error) via structlog
  2. Retry with exponential backoff: [5s, 30s, 120s]
  3. After 3 retries: status = 'error', write to raw_collector_errors, alert Sentry
  4. Do NOT crash — other broker collectors must keep running

On fetch failure (single entity):
  1. Log error with full context (broker_id, entity, cursor, error)
  2. Write to raw_collector_errors
  3. Skip entity, continue with next
  4. Do NOT stop entire sync run

On save failure:
  1. Log error with payload context
  2. Write to raw_collector_errors
  3. Retain cursor at last successful position
  4. Do NOT advance cursor past failed records
```

### Circuit breaker

5 consecutive failures on a source system:
- Set connection status = `circuit_open`
- Stop attempting for 10 minutes
- Alert Sentry with broker_id and source_system tags
- Resume automatically after cooldown

### API error response shape

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Account not found",
    "detail": {},
    "request_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

Never return raw Python exceptions or stack traces in API responses.

### Structured logging standard

```python
log.info(
    "collector.sync.completed",
    broker_id=str(broker_id),
    source_system="mt5",
    server_id=str(server_id),
    entity="deals",
    records_fetched=450,
    records_saved=450,
    duration_ms=1240,
    cursor=new_cursor,
)
```

Never use `print()`. Never use bare `logging.info("message")` without context fields.

---

## API Layer Standard

### Versioning

All routes prefixed `/api/v1/`. No unversioned routes.

```
/api/v1/accounts/
/api/v1/deals/
/api/v1/rules/
/api/v1/collectors/
/api/v1/actions/
/api/v1/audit/
```

Breaking changes introduce `/api/v2/` for affected routes. Deprecate v1 with sunset header before removal.

### Middleware execution order

```
Request in
  → Rate limiting
  → JWT validation
  → broker_id resolution
  → RBAC enforcement
  → Route handler
Response out
  → Request ID injection
  → Structured access log
```

### Route pattern (FastAPI)

```python
router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1/accounts", tags=["accounts"])

@router.get("/")
async def list_accounts(
    broker_ctx: BrokerContext = Depends(get_broker_context),
    filters: AccountFilters = Depends(),
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
):
    ...
```

---

## Testing Standard

| Layer | Framework |
|---|---|
| Backend unit tests | pytest |
| Backend integration tests | pytest + real PostgreSQL (Docker) |
| Frontend unit tests | Jest |
| Frontend E2E tests | Playwright |

### Test locations

```
services/api/tests/             ← API route and middleware tests
services/collector-mt5/tests/   ← Collector unit tests with mocked MT5Manager
services/collector-mt4/tests/   ← Collector unit tests with mocked DLL
services/collector-ctrader/tests/ ← Collector unit tests with mocked Protobuf
packages/db/tests/              ← DB model and migration tests
tests/integration/              ← Cross-service integration tests
tests/fixtures/                 ← Real captured JSON from MT5, MT4, cTrader, FXBO
dashboard/tests/                ← Frontend unit and E2E tests
```

### Test rules

- Every collector method MUST have a unit test with mocked source responses
- Every API route MUST have integration tests: success, auth failure, wrong broker_id, invalid payload, RBAC rejection
- Mock payloads MUST be real captured JSON from source systems in tests/fixtures/
- Never write tests that require a live MT4/MT5/cTrader/FXBO connection
- All tests must pass in CI before merge

---

## Observability Standard

### Logging — structlog

JSON output in production. Pretty output in local dev. Level via `FXDEALER_LOG_LEVEL`.

```
DEBUG    ← collector step traces (local only)
INFO     ← normal operations, sync completions, route access
WARNING  ← retries, degraded state, slow queries
ERROR    ← failures requiring attention
CRITICAL ← service-level failures, circuit breakers open
```

### Metrics — Prometheus

```
fxdealer_collector_sync_duration_seconds{broker_id, source_system, entity}
fxdealer_collector_records_ingested_total{broker_id, source_system, entity}
fxdealer_collector_errors_total{broker_id, source_system, error_type}
fxdealer_api_request_duration_seconds{route, method, status}
fxdealer_rule_engine_evaluations_total{rule_id, severity}
fxdealer_db_query_duration_seconds{query_type, table}
```

### Error tracking — Sentry

Every service configures Sentry. Every unhandled exception and every circuit breaker event reported with:
- `broker_id` tag
- `source_system` tag
- `environment` tag (dev / staging / production)

Never silence exceptions without logging to Sentry first.

---

## Architecture Rules — MUST Follow

```
- All collector services MUST implement BaseCollector interface
- All collectors MUST be tenant-aware and carry broker_id
- All collectors MUST support: connect, health_check, bootstrap_sync,
  incremental_sync, fetch_entity, save_raw, log_run, handle_error
- All collector scheduling MUST use ARQ — not cron, not raw asyncio loops
- MT5 collectors MUST use MT5Manager pip package
- MT4 collectors MUST use ctypes wrapper around the broker-provided DLL
- cTrader collectors MUST use Protobuf over TCP (Spotware Manager API)
- Raw source data MUST be stored exactly as returned by source
- Raw source payload MUST always be preserved in payload_json
- Rule engine outputs MUST include:
    rule_id, broker_id, account_id, severity (low|medium|high|critical),
    evidence_json, timestamp
- All API routes MUST be prefixed /api/v1/
- All API routes MUST validate payloads with Pydantic (Python) or Zod (Node.js)
- All API routes MUST pass through RBAC middleware before handler executes
- All credentials MUST be stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- All services MUST use structlog for structured logging
- All services MUST expose Prometheus /metrics endpoint
- All unhandled exceptions MUST be reported to Sentry with broker_id tag
- All AI suggestions MUST be logged before any action is taken
- All manual and automatic actions MUST create audit log entries
- All database writes MUST include broker_id where applicable
- All queries touching tenant data MUST filter by broker_id
- All collector runs MUST produce success/failure logs in raw_collector_runs
- Time-series raw tables MUST be created as TimescaleDB hypertables
- All raw tables MUST have composite index on (broker_id, collected_at DESC)
- TimescaleDB retention policies MUST be defined in Alembic migrations
```

---

## Architecture Rules — MUST NOT Do

```
- Never connect directly to MT4/MT5/cTrader/CRM from frontend
- Never store only transformed data without preserving raw payload_json
- Never expose secrets, credentials, or manager connection details in API responses
- Never return raw Python exceptions or stack traces in API responses
- Never use print() — always structlog
- Never commit .env.local or any file with real credentials
- Never store production secrets in plain environment variables
- Never execute actions without first creating an audit log entry
- Never execute AI-based actions without storing AI suggestion and evidence first
- Never delete trading data physically — soft delete / archive only
- Never mix data across tenants
- Never query tenant data without broker_id filtering
- Never allow one broker user to access another broker's data
- Never let collectors write rule-engine outputs into dashboard tables
- Never let frontend call privileged endpoints without RBAC check
- Never design raw schemas from imagination — always from real source responses
- Never create rule engine or AI schema tables until collector contracts are stable
- Never create unversioned API routes
- Never advance collector cursor past failed records
- Never silence exceptions without logging to Sentry
- Never use cron or bare asyncio loops for collector scheduling — use ARQ
- Never hardcode MT4 DLL paths — always load from broker connection config
```

---

## Soft Delete Policy

```
- Raw source records are append-only by default
- Archive instead of delete: status = 'archived', archived_at = NOW()
- Re-syncs create superseding records: status = 'superseded'
- Audit logs are immutable — no soft delete, no archive, no modification
```

---

## Design System

### UI Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Component library | shadcn/ui |
| Icons | Lucide React |
| Data tables | TanStack Table v8 |
| Charts / graphs | Recharts |
| Geo maps | React Leaflet + CartoDB Dark Matter tiles |
| Widgets | Custom components built on shadcn/ui primitives |

---

### Color Palette

```
Background (page base)     #020202
Card background            transparent
Sidebar active item        #161616
Borders                    #1C1C1C
Primary action             #2D61FF  ← buttons, links, active states
Green accent               #3BA468  ← success, healthy, positive PnL
Text secondary             #818181
Text primary               #FFFFFF
```

CSS variables — define in `dashboard/styles/globals.css`. Use everywhere. Never hardcode hex values in components.

```css
:root {
  --bg-base:           #020202;
  --bg-card:           transparent;
  --bg-sidebar-active: #161616;
  --border:            #1C1C1C;
  --primary:           #2D61FF;
  --accent-green:      #3BA468;
  --text-primary:      #FFFFFF;
  --text-secondary:    #818181;

  /* Risk severity — used consistently across ALL tables, badges, charts */
  --risk-critical:     #EF4444;
  --risk-high:         #F97316;
  --risk-medium:       #F59E0B;
  --risk-low:          #3BA468;
  --risk-none:         #818181;
}
```

**Light mode toggle** — available in the profile dropdown in the top nav bar. Light mode overrides CSS variables only. All components use variables — never hardcoded colors. Never build light-mode-only or dark-mode-only components.

---

### Typography

```
Primary font:     Inter (Google Fonts)
Monospace font:   JetBrains Mono
                  → used for: trade IDs, account logins, prices,
                    volumes, timestamps, any numeric trading data

Font scale:
  Page title:     20px / 700
  Section title:  16px / 600
  Table header:   13px / 500 / uppercase / letter-spacing wide
  Body:           14px / 400
  Small / muted:  12px / 400 / var(--text-secondary)
  Data values:    14px monospace / tabular-nums
```

Rule: all numeric trading data (prices, volumes, PnL, IDs, logins) renders in monospace with `tabular-nums` so table columns align correctly.

---

└──────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Top nav bar

- Fixed, full width, always visible
- Left: Logo
- Center: Global search bar (searches users, accounts, email)
- Right: Notification icon only (no label) + Profile icon only (no label)
- **Notification panel** → opens as a collapsible right sidebar, slides in from right, full height, closeable
- **Profile menu** → dropdown below icon:
  - Profile settings
  - Light / Dark mode toggle
  - Logout

#### Left sidebar

- Fixed left, full height, always visible on desktop
- Each nav item: icon + text label (never icons alone)
- Collapsible sections with sub-items (accordion style)
- Active item: background `--bg-sidebar-active`, left border accent `--primary`
- Section headers: uppercase, small, muted color

#### Responsive behavior

```
Desktop  > 1280px  → sidebar always visible, full layout
Tablet   768–1280px → sidebar hidden, hamburger menu top-left
Mobile   < 768px   → hamburger menu, single column layout
```

On tablet and mobile, hamburger opens sidebar as a full-height overlay.

### Data Tables

Every table in the platform follows this standard — no exceptions.

**Required features on every table:**

```
- Column sorting (click header — asc / desc / none)
- Global search bar above the table
- Per-column filter (filter icon in each column header)
- Pagination: configurable rows per page (25 / 50 / 100)
- Column visibility toggle (show/hide columns dropdown)
- Export to CSV button
- Row click → opens detail panel or navigates to detail page
- Loading state: skeleton rows (not spinner)
- Empty state: icon + title + description — never a blank space
```

**Per-column filter operators (all columns support all relevant operators):**

```
Contains
Does not contain
Equals
Does not equal
Greater than          ← numeric / date columns
Less than             ← numeric / date columns
Comma separated       ← multi-value match (e.g. "EURUSD,GBPUSD")
Is blank
Is not blank
```

**Risk / severity badge colors (used consistently everywhere):**

```
CRITICAL  → #EF4444  (red)
HIGH      → #F97316  (orange)
MEDIUM    → #F59E0B  (yellow/amber)
LOW       → #3BA468  (green)
NONE      → #818181  (muted grey)
```

**Implementation:**
- TanStack Table v8
- Column definitions: `dashboard/components/tables/columns/`
- Shared filter logic: `dashboard/lib/table-filters.ts`
- Shared table wrapper component: `dashboard/components/tables/DataTable.tsx`

---

### Charts, Graphs, Widgets, Geo Maps

#### Charts — Recharts

Used for: PnL over time, trade volume by hour/day, exposure by symbol, win rate, slippage distribution, rule engine detection trends.

Rules:
- All chart colors use CSS variables — never hardcoded hex
- Always show skeleton loader while data is loading
- Always show empty state message if no data returns
- Tooltips include: label, value, unit, timestamp where relevant
- Axis labels in `--text-secondary` color
- Grid lines in `--border` color

#### Widgets (summary metric cards)

Top of every page — 4 per row desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile:

```
┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐
│  Total Accounts │  │  Flagged Today  │  │  Open Positions │  │  Net Exposure   │
│  12,450         │  │  🔴 34          │  │  892            │  │  $2.4M          │
│  ↑ 2.3% today   │  │  ↑ 5 new        │  │  ↓ 12 closed    │  │  ↑ $140K        │
└─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘
```

Each widget: label, primary value (large), secondary context (delta / count / %). Color primary value based on meaning (green for positive, risk color for flagged counts).

#### Geo Maps — React Leaflet

Used in: account investigation (IP geolocation), multi-account clustering by region, LP geographic distribution.

Rules:
- Tile layer: CartoDB Dark Matter (`https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/dark_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png`)
- Cluster dense markers with `react-leaflet-cluster`
- Click marker → opens popover with account/IP details
- Always show a loading state before map tiles render

---

### Global Search Bar

Located center of top nav bar.

**Searchable entities:**
- Users (name, email)
- Trading accounts (login, account number)
- Email address

**Behavior:**
- Dropdown results appear below the bar, grouped by type (Users / Accounts)
- Debounced — API call fires 300ms after typing stops
- Keyboard navigable (↑ ↓ arrows + Enter to select)
- Click result → navigates to relevant detail page
- Shows "No results" state if nothing matches

---

### Component Rules

```
- Use shadcn/ui as base — never rebuild what shadcn already provides
- All modals use shadcn Dialog
- All dropdowns use shadcn DropdownMenu
- All forms use shadcn Form + React Hook Form + Zod validation
- All tooltips use shadcn Tooltip
- All toast notifications use shadcn Sonner
- All date pickers use shadcn Calendar + date-fns
- All skeleton loaders use shadcn Skeleton
- Never use a spinner as the only loading indicator — always skeleton
- Never show a blank page or empty div for empty/loading states
- All timestamps shown in broker local timezone, UTC on hover tooltip
- All monetary values: locale-aware formatting, comma separators, 2 decimal places
- All prices and volumes: monospace font, tabular-nums CSS class
- All risk severity values: colored badge using CSS risk variables
```

---

### Frontend Skill

The frontend design skill is at `.claude/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md`.

When building any dashboard page or component, Claude must:
1. Read this Design System section in CLAUDE.md
2. Load `.claude/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md`
3. Check `dashboard/components/` for existing reusable components before creating new ones
4. Never hardcode colors — always use CSS variables
5. Never build a component that shadcn/ui already provides
6. Never skip loading states or empty states

## Immediate Next Step

```
Do NOT let Claude generate full platform schemas in one shot.

Correct order:
1. Connect to MT5 test server using MT5Manager
2. Inspect real API responses entity by entity
3. Capture real payloads into tests/fixtures/mt5/
4. Document fields in .claude/references/mt5manager-sdk/
5. Build MT5 collector from real payloads
6. Freeze MT5 raw schema from actual data
7. Only then move to MT4, cTrader, FXBO

## Business Model & Deployment Strategy

### Current model: SaaS (Phase 1 — up to 10 clients)

```
AI FXDealer hosted on AWS (your infrastructure)
Each broker/prop firm = one tenant, isolated by broker_id
Broker accesses via subdomain: broker-name.fxdealer.com
You manage all infrastructure, updates, monitoring
Broker pays monthly subscription
```

Pricing reference points for this market:
```
Prop firms (5K accounts):      $500  – $1,500 / month
Small brokers (30K accounts):  $1,500 – $3,000 / month
```

AWS cost at launch (6 clients):
```
Compute (EC2):          ~$615/month
Database (RDS+Redis):   ~$530/month
Storage + transfer:     ~$95/month
Supporting services:    ~$55/month
Total:                  ~$1,500/month
```

Gross margin at 6 clients:
```
At $1,000/client avg:  $6,000 revenue  →  75% margin
At $2,000/client avg:  $12,000 revenue →  87.5% margin
```

Cost scaling:
```
6  clients / 105K accounts →  ~$1,500/month AWS
15 clients / 300K accounts →  ~$2,800/month AWS
30 clients / 600K accounts →  ~$4,500/month AWS
50 clients / 1M+  accounts →  ~$7,000/month AWS
```

### Future model: Self-Hosted Licensed (after 10 clients)

```
Trigger: client count exceeds 10, or first regulated broker requires it

- Broker provides their own server
- You provide installation package + license key
- License validated against your license server on startup
- Platform refuses to start without valid license
- Broker's data never leaves their infrastructure
- Premium pricing: one-time license + annual support/update contract
```

Codebase flag — design for it now, build it later:
```
DEPLOYMENT_MODE=saas          ← current, multi-tenant, your AWS
DEPLOYMENT_MODE=selfhosted    ← future, single-tenant, broker's server
```

Both modes share the same codebase. Do NOT build self-hosted mode yet.
Keep tenant isolation clean and startup config flexible so it can be
added without major refactoring.

### Subdomain model per tenant

```
app.fxdealer.com                ← marketing / login
broker-alpha.fxdealer.com       ← Broker Alpha dashboard
prop-firm-beta.fxdealer.com     ← Prop Firm Beta dashboard
```

DNS via Route 53. Each subdomain resolves broker_id at auth middleware.
No broker can access another broker's subdomain.

```

Windows collector note: MT4/MT5 Manager API are Windows-only.
collector-mt4 and collector-mt5 run on Windows EC2 (cost ~40% more).
Optimization for Phase 2+: consolidate multiple broker collectors
onto fewer Windows instances. Do not over-optimize in Phase 1.
